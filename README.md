# API Scout

**API Scout** is a platform designed to automate API documentation, testing, and monitoring for developers. It centralizes the management of API schemas, tracks versions, and offers real-time monitoring, all in one place. API Scout aims to simplify the workflow of developers and teams by providing a comprehensive tool for managing APIs efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated API Documentation**: Import your API schema (OpenAPI or Swagger) and generate interactive documentation automatically.
- **API Testing**: Test your API endpoints directly within the platform. Customize requests and view real-time responses.
- **Version Control**: Track and manage different versions of your APIs. View the history of changes and restore previous versions when needed.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of your APIs with real-time data, including response times and error rates.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Get notified instantly when your API performance degrades or errors occur, keeping you proactive.
